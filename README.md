## Dark Theme
If you are a Firefox user and use a dark theme, you can add these lines to your `userChrome.css` file to make Redirector's extension button more visible:

```css
/* Redirector button for dark Firefox themes */
toolbarbutton#toggle-button--redirectoreinaregilssoncom-redirector[image*="active"] { filter: invert(1) brightness(6); }
toolbarbutton#toggle-button--redirectoreinaregilssoncom-redirector[image*="disabled"] { filter: invert(1) brightness(2.5); }
```

If you don't know what the `userChrome.css` file is, or how to edit it, please look it up on a Firefox forum instead of asking about it in this repository. Thanks!
